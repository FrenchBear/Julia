# Constructors are functions that create new objects â€“ specifically, instances of Composite Types.
# In Julia, type objects also serve as constructor functions: they create new instances of themselves when applied to an argument tuple as a function.
struct Foo
    bar
    baz
end

foo = Foo(1, 2)     # Foo(1, 2)
println(foo.bar)    # 1
println(foo.baz)    # 2
println()


# Outer Constructor Methods
# A constructor is just like any other function in Julia in that its overall behavior is defined by the combined behavior of its methods.
# Accordingly, you can add functionality to a constructor by simply defining new methods.
# For example, let's say you want to add a constructor method for Foo objects that takes only one argument:
Foo(x) = Foo(x, x)
Foo(1)      # Foo(1, 1)

# You could also add a zero-argument Foo constructor method that supplies default values for both of the bar and baz fields:
Foo() = Foo(0)
Foo()       # Foo(0, 0)


# Inner Constructor Methods
# While outer constructor methods succeed in addressing the problem of providing additional convenience methods for constructing objects,
# they fail to address the other two use cases: enforcing invariants, and allowing construction of self-referential objects.
# For these problems, one needs inner constructor methods.
# An inner constructor method is like an outer constructor method, except for two differences:
# - It is declared inside the block of a type declaration, rather than outside of it like normal methods.
# - It has access to a special locally existent function called new that creates objects of the block's type.

# For example, suppose one wants to declare a type that holds a pair of real numbers, subject to the constraint that the first number
# is not greater than the second one. One could declare it like this:
struct OrderedPair
    x::Real
    y::Real
    OrderedPair(x, y) = x > y ? error("out of order") : new(x, y)
end

OrderedPair(1, 2)   # OrderedPair(1, 2)
# OrderedPair(2,1)  # ERROR: out of order

# If the type were declared mutable, you could reach in and directly change the field values to violate this invariant.
# Of course, messing around with an object's internals uninvited is bad practice

# Once a type is declared, there is no way to add more inner constructor methods. Since outer constructor methods can only
# create objects by calling other constructor methods, ultimately, some inner constructor must be called to create an object.
# This guarantees that all objects of the declared type must come into existence by a call to one of the inner constructor
# methods provided with the type, thereby giving some degree of enforcement of a type's invariants.

# If any inner constructor method is defined, no default constructor method is provided: it is presumed that you have supplied
# yourself with all the inner constructors you need.
struct T2
    x::Int64
    T2(n::Int8) = new(Int64(n))
end
T2(Int8(12))    # T2(12)
# T2(-5)        # MethodError: no method matching T2(::Int64)

# The default constructor is equivalent to writing your own inner constructor
# method that takes all of the object's fields as parameters (constrained to be of the correct type, if the corresponding field has a type),
# and passes them to new, returning the resulting object:
let
    struct Foo
        bar
        baz
        Foo(bar, baz) = new(bar, baz)
    end
end


# Simple example of (non-balanced) b-tree
let
    mutable struct Node{T}
        value::T
        left::Union{Node,Nothing}
        right::Union{Node,Nothing}
    end

    # Root of b-tree
    root::Union{Node,Nothing} = nothing

    # Insert value in b-tree
    function treeins(value::T) where {T}
        nn = Node(value, nothing, nothing)
        if (isnothing(root))
            #        println("Insert $value as root")
            root = nn
        else
            r = root
            while true
                if value < r.value
                    if isnothing(r.left)
                        r.left = nn
                        #                    println("Insert $value as left node of $(r.value)")
                        return
                    else
                        r = r.left

                        #                    println("Insert $value as right node of $(r.value)")
                        r.right = nn
                        return
                    else
                        r = r.right
                    end
                else
                    @error "Dumplicate value $value"
                end
            end
        end
    end

    # Print sorted tree
    function printtree(n::Union{Node,Nothing})
        !isnothing(n) || return
        printtree(n.left)
        print(n.value, ' ')
        printtree(n.right)
    end

    treeins(7)
    treeins(2)
    treeins(-2)
    treeins(8)
    treeins(-1)
    treeins(5)
    treeins(3)

# Incomplete initialization

# To allow for the creation of incompletely initialized objects, Julia allows the new function to be called
# with fewer than the number of fields that the type has, returning an object with the unspecified fields uninitialized.
# While you are allowed to create objects with uninitialized fields, any access to an uninitialized reference is an immediate error.

mutable struct SelfReferential
    obj::SelfReferential
    SelfReferential() = (x = new(); x.obj = x)
end

x = SelfReferential()
println(x === x)            # true
println(x === x.obj)        # true
println(x === x.obj.obj)    # true


# Parametric constructors

struct Point{T<:Real}
    x::T
    y::T
end

# Point, Point{Float64} and Point{Int64} are all different constructor functions.
# In fact, Point{T} is a distinct constructor function for each type T.
# Without any explicitly provided inner constructors, the declaration of the composite type Point{T<:Real}
# automatically provides an inner constructor, Point{T}, for each possible type T<:Real, that behaves just
# like non-parametric default inner constructors do.
# It also provides a single general outer Point constructor that takes pairs of real arguments, which must be
# of the same type. This automatic provision of constructors is equivalent to the following explicit declaration:
let
    struct Point{T<:Real}
        x::T
        y::T
        Point{T}(x, y) where {T<:Real} = new(x, y)
    end

    Point(x::T, y::T) where {T<:Real} = Point{T}(x, y)
end

# Notice that each definition looks like the form of constructor call that it handles.
# The call Point{Int64}(1,2) will invoke the definition Point{T}(x,y) inside the struct block.
# The outer constructor declaration, on the other hand, defines a method for the general Point constructor
# which only applies to pairs of values of the same real type. This declaration makes constructor calls
# without explicit type parameters, like Point(1,2) and Point(1.0,2.5), work.
# Since the method declaration restricts the arguments to being of the same type, calls like Point(1,2.5),
# with arguments of different types, result in "no method" errors.

# To allow specific integer values as 1st argument work, we can vrite another outer constructor
Point(x::Int64, y::Float64) = Point(convert(Float64, x), y)

# But this doesn't work for other similar calls such as Point(1.5,2)
# The following outer method definition to make all calls to the general Point constructor work as one would expect:

Point(x::Real, y::Real) = Point(promote(x, y)...)

# Not it works:
Point(1.5,2)        # Point{Float64}(1.5, 2.0)
Point(1,1//2)       # Point{Rational{Int64}}(1//1, 1//2)
Point(1.0,1//2)     # Point{Float64}(1.0, 0.5)
